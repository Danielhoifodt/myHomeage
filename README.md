mostly html and css, but i have some lines with  react in tester.html


For the files tasklist.html and tasklist.js i have a question.... Can you check out the bug in tasklist.js it is about the local storage.
When i click the x, to delete a task i don`t delete the task from local storage. What is wrong? Free beer if you find out!
